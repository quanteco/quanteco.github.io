Welcome to my blog!  This blog focuses on different quantitative topics that I have found intriguing.  For the most part it will focus on exercises and scripts that I have developed in R or JAGS. However, I would like to eventually incorporate some scripting exercises for other programs and languages as well.  The goal of most of these blogs is to develop functions or models that are fully functional for multiple users and uses.
